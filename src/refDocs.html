  <h2>Please find below a list of documents that will help guide you in building your cooperative:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A Technology Freelancers’ Guide to Starting a Worker Cooperative: <a href="https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/resources/356%202009_Johnson%20etal_Tech%20Freelancers%20Guide%20to%20Worker%20Co-ops.pdf">Here</a></li>
  <li>Walk each founding member through creating a Signal profile for group messaging and set up the group chat. <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Here.</a></li>
  <li>Walk each founding member through creating a Secure Calendar, <a href="https://securecalendar.online/">Here.</a> or Tutanota encrypted calendar account for scheduling meetings, <a href="https://tutanota.com/calendar/">Here.</a></li>
</ul>
Create accountability system certifying that each member has read each relevant section presented by the app as a step in the startup process (simultaneously, try to present all info as precisely as possible, with access more details if desired); at least ensure that each page has been open and on screen long enough, in principle, for it to have been read by the user. Require each member attest that they have read the information before moving on.
V.                  Ensure all founding members have attested they have read each page or watched each video before moving to the next step.
VI.               Present general, concise information on worker-cooperative business structure.
VII.             Provide founding members with contact info for cooperative development organizations such as  <a href="https://cdi.coop/">the Cooperative Development Institute</a> <a href="https://institute.coop/startup">the Democracy at Work Institute</a>, and the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives (https://www.usworker.coop/startups/).
VIII.          Provide decision help with choosing legal business entity form, typically either LLC or cooperative corporation (IRS form 1120-C). Cooperative corporation should be the default choice if worker-owners can anticipate making at least minimum wage from the start, as this is required by law since they are considered employees. If they cannot expect to make at least minimum wage from the beginning, they may want to form under an LLC with a transition plan in place to switch to a cooperative corporation as soon as expected revenues are sufficient. The reason is that cooperative corporations as a business form are typically more resilient against possible efforts to “de-cooperativize” them in the future.
IX.                Provide functionality to help choose business name (checking to see if name is already taken, advising that the business can only have “cooperative” in the name in CA if it is incorporated specifically as a cooperative corporation) (possibly use https://www.uspto.gov/trademark and state Secretary of State registry website).
X.                  Generate business charter based on business type and name chosen; any forms that need to be signed generated and presented to founding members via DocuSign. (https://www.co-oplaw.org/ is highly useful)
XI. Help members schedule founding meeting, and provide pre-generated agenda with necessary business items, especially the selection of Board of Directors.
XII.             Provide info for non-managerial members to immediately contact and organize with United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (UE) (https://www.ueunion.org/) (one of two unions of which I am aware that have initiatives to organize union-coops, the other being the United Steelworkers; the UE is organized along a model more in line with the democratic worker cooperative itself, however).
XIII.          Walk President/CEO through setting up crowdsourcing profile(s) to raise money for incorporation fees.
XIV.           Generate IRS (LLC https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc or cooperative corporation https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/forming-a-corporation and state tax documents to submit (with names of officers) and walk officers through payment of incorporation fees.
XV.             Walk treasurer/controller through setting up easy-to-use accounting/business expense-tracking app/software (QuickBooks Online is pretty much the gold standard https://quickbooks.intuit.com/online/).
XVI.           Walk officers through applying for non-equity funding, such as through the National Cooperative Bank (https://www.ncb.coop/) and via revenue-based financing (e.g., Lighter Capital https://www.lightercapital.com/revenue-based-financing/, GSD Capital https://gsdcapital.vc/revenue-based-financing/, etc).
XVII.        Provide directory assistance for new programmers’s cooperatives to see all other cooperatives founded via the program and to suggest potential contract and partnership opportunities.
XVIII.      Provide recruitment functionality for new cooperatives founded via the program to view prospective hires’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
XIX.      Algorithmically determine division of company profits between members according to one-member/one-share principle, tenure principle, and value-added principle.
