(The following is a sample document to found the Articles of co-op entity. Although it is built after a legal form in the state of California, it is by no means, a legally binding form.)

<h1>SAMPLE ARTICLES OF ENTITY</h1>
<h1>FOR A WORKER COOPERATIVE</h1>
<h1>WITH A COLLECTIVE BOARD</h1>
<br>
<p>Prepared by members of the California Worker Cooperative Policy Coalition, including: the East Bay Community Law Center (EBCLC), the Sustainable Economies Law Center (SELC), Tuttle Law Group, the Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives, and Cutting Edge Counsel, adapted from bylaws prepared by Tim Huet and Jenny Kassan.</p>
<p>A few things to note about these Sample Articles:</p>
<p>1.	About the Explanatory Footnotes: These Articles are provided for teaching purposes. All Explanatory Footnotes are meant to explain the purpose, meaning, alternatives, or legal background of a provision. It is important to consider the explanations in the footnotes, as particular drafting choices will better serve one’s business entity, depending on the entity’s activities and the concerns of its membership. The footnotes should be deleted if you use and adapt the Articles for your own purposes. They are not meant to be legally enforceable provisions of the Articles.</p>
<p>2.	Use These Articles With Caution: Please note that you should not assume these Articles are sufficiently thorough or applicable to your cooperative. This form should not be construed as legal advice. Please seek the advice of an attorney before adopting Articles, and be sure that any Articles you adopt are tailored to the specific needs of your cooperative and to the requirements of California law. Some entities may need to include additional provisions not discussed in this document to effectuate particular business objectives.</p>
<p>3.	These Articles Were Written to Adhere to California Law: Unless otherwise specified, all references to a particular code section or to the “Statute” are to the California Cooperative entities Statute, which is found starting at section 12200 of the California Corporations Code. If you are uncertain about whether you can change provisions of these Articles, refer to the relevant section of the Statute, which often sets minimum requirements for meeting procedures, notice, and other matters.</p>
<p>4.	We Are Continually Improving on These Articles: This draft was last revised in May 2016 in response to newly enacted statutory provisions per Assembly Bill 816 (Bonta, passed in 2015, effective January 1, 2016). Please check our website for updates: http://www.co-oplaw.org/cooperative-bylaws/, and let us know if you have any suggestions or find any errors. Thank you!</p>
